Release 0.1:

I started creating the project thinking about a simple and responsive design for a realtor page.


Release 0.5:

Halfway through the process, a contact form was thought of, which was placed with a box-shadow effect on the main image of the page. Soon after completing the form, a mosaic was created with catch phrases and images of the property.

Release 1.0:

I adjusted some elements to make the site even more responsive and remove bugs in the layout and created a simple footer that will be changed in the future.
